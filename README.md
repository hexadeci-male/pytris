# READ ME (Or don't...see what I care.)

This is a Python-based (using the 'Pygame' module) version of Tetris (unofficial, of course). Code by hexadeci-male and Tetris by Alexey Pajitnov. Other things made by other groups and people that I couldn't be bothered to blah-blah-blah bleeeeeehhhhhhh............

# REQUIREMENTS:

Python script and source need Python 3.6+ and Pygame to play and execute.

# INSTALL & PLAY:

Simply run the 'Pytris' executable/app (or "pytris" script if applicable) and make sure the 'assets' folder is in the same directory as the program itself, otherwise the game won't run!

The game automatically creates/saves your game settings and highscores to some text files inside the asset folder. These files can be safely deleted.

Don't mess with the asset folder, unless you know what you are doing. The game won't load without the asset folder and it's proper contents.

You can replace the sounds/graphics files with your own if you want...just make sure it's the same name and file type.

# SOURCE CODE:

You can find the source code and other stuff for this game on my GitHub (https://github.com/hexadeci-male)

Play around with it or whatever if you're good at coding/python

If someone wants to make a pyinstaller/py2app mac executable of this game (icons are included), that would be awesome and I would be grateful. I tried it myself but I failed spectacularly for various reasons. :(

# NONSENSE:

This was more a coding exercise rather than a full-fledged game dev project. No copyright infringement intended - just needed some assets from the interwebz. I have no idea who made what, except for my code.
